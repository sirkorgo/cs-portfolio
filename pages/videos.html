    <h2>Video Production #1</h2>
    <p>In this project, I experimented with the Canva video editing tool. The goal was to make a 30 second video with images and audio. However, I turned the project into a YouTube video which recieved 1.5K views, and was the first video uploaded to my YouTube channel.</p>
